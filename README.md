# Mentorship Challenges

Welcome to the Mentorship Challenges repository! This is a dedicated space where I will regularly add coding and
problem-solving challenges based on our discussions and learning objectives. These challenges are designed to enhance
your skills and reinforce concepts we cover during our mentorship sessions.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each representing a specific challenge set or topic. I will constantly
update it with new challenges and resources.

Each directory contains:
- A `README.md` with specific instructions for the challenge.
- Any starter code if applicable.
- Example input and output files if necessary.

## Getting Started

To get started with a challenge:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/daniangelos/mentorship-challenges.git
   cd mentorship-challenges

2. **Navigate to the Challenge Directory**
   ```bash
   cd challenge-n

3. **Read the Instructions**

   Open the `README.md` file for the specific challenge to understand the requirements and objectives.

4. **Implement and Test Your Solution**

   Utilize the starter code if provided, and run tests to ensure your solution meets all requirements.

### Goals

These challenges aim to:

- Reinforce concepts covered in meetings.
- Encourage independent problem-solving.
- Foster coding best practices and clean code.
- Prepare you for real-world coding tasks and interviews.
